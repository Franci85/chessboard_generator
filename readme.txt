Hello, the python scrip chessboard_generator_eng.py make a chessboard pattern made of number of squares for each side at your choice.
The program asks you to choose how many squares per side you want on your board.
Then it shows you an empty window of the final dimensions of the board, to continue press any key on the keyboard.
Finally the chessboard will be shown.
To close the windows, press any key on the keyboard.

Tu run the script you need to have python 3 installed on your computer, and the following python packages intalled using PIP:
- opencv-pyton
- numpy
In the same folder of the script chessboard_generator_eng.py make a folder called "src" and save inside the file colors.py.
The file colors.py is the source of the BGR color codes used by opencv library.

I created this script thanks to what i learned in this opencv python tutorial on YouTube:
